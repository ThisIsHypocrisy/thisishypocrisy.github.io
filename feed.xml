    <title>This Is Hypocrisy</title>
    <description>This Is Hypocrisy archives every instance of hypocrisy from the mainstream media. Many media companies stretch and bend reality to spin a story, and sometimes they get caught. To keep them accountable, we plan to archive every instance of hypocrisy to understand the extent of the deception.

        <title>NBC, Amazon, and Cartoon Network Writer Asks for White Extinction</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;On June 25th, Taylor Cox, a writer for many children’s TV shows including Just Add Magic, Swamp Talk with Shrek &amp;amp; Donkey, OMG!, and Kung Fu Panda tweeted this statement: “the only anxiety i have about white Extinction is that it’s not happening fast enough”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cox has since deleted the tweet and took her Twitter account private.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a progressive, it’s surprising that she has convinced herself that it’s okay to publicly ask for the extinction of an entire human race. I guess, when your need to virtue signal overcomes critical thinking, this is the result.&lt;/p&gt;
