          <p>There was a brief period of public outrage against family separations at the border. Mainstream media organizations published article after article admonishing Trump on the issue. The problem is, family separations at the border are not exclusive to the Trump administration, they happened frequently under Obama too. Not surprisingly, the media gave Obama a pass on the issue.</p>

<p>Family separations at the border happen when adults with accompanying children are caught illegally crossing the border. If the adults were prosecuted and sent to a federal jail, the children are required by law to be separated from them. The children cannot stay in federal jail with their prosecuted adults.</p>

<p>Prosecuting adults for illegally crossing the border is not a new practice, nor is it unreasonable (since it’s illegal). However, not all adults who illegally cross the border are prosecuted, some are held in immigration detention until a judge determines whether to deport them or not. If the adults are not prosecuted, family separation does not occur.</p>

<p>The Obama administration prosecuted adults caught illegally crossing the border and thus would often separate families. In fact, in July 2014, the Fair Immigration Reform Movement (FIRM) issued a blistering press release denouncing the Obama administration’s “needless family separations”.</p>

<p>Here’s an excerpt from the <a href="https://fairimmigration.org/press/president-obama-must-stop-family-separation-crisis">press release</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“This week alone, hundreds if not thousands of children will lose parents to our broken immigration system, which causes needless family separations every day. A recent report noted that more than 72,000 children lost parents to deportations in 2013 alone. Against that backdrop, President Obama and his Administration would do well in moving to provide relief to immigrant families who would otherwise live in fear of separation”.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On this issue, the only difference between the Obama and Trump administrations is that the latter established a “zero tolerance” policy to prosecute all adults caught illegally crossing the border. Although this increases the rate of family separations, the exact increase is unknown.</p>

<p>The mainstream media stirred public outrage at Trump for family separations at the border, but were oddly quiet when the same kind of separations happened under Obama. Did the media believe that migrant families separated under Obama were less important than the families separated under Trump? Or do they not care about those families and are really just pushing an agenda?</p>

<p>Finally, besides the double standard in reporting, the outrage against family seperations for illegal border crossings simply does not make sense. Migrants can easily follow the law to avoid family seperations. In addition, family seperations already happen frequently within the country (prosecuted and jailed parents are separated from their children). Why do migrants deserve better treatment if they break the law?</p>

          <p>The Time magazine used a photograph of a crying Honduran girl at a border crossing in its July 2, 2018 magazine issue to symbolize Trump’s border immigration policy. The photograph of the girl was juxtaposed with Trump and the words “Welcome to America”. The goal is clear: the magazine is using the sad photograph to demonize Trump and the US government’s border immigration policy. Specifically, the magazine is protesting the policy of separating migrant families caught illegally crossing the border.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, there’s a serious problem for the magazine here. First, the girl <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2018/06/22/time-magazines-major-screw-up-on-the-crying-girl-cover/?utm_term=.92d026528c01">was not separated from her family</a>. She was with her mother when they encountered US border officials. The officials searched the mother on the spot and at no point in the encounter separated the girl and her mother.</p>

<p>It’s unclear whether the magazine intentionally misled their audience with the photograph or they made an erroneous assumption. In both cases, the implications are troublesome. The magazine was either manipulating facts to exploit the plight of the girl to push an agenda, or it was sloppy with its research, something that should not happen with a top tier publication.</p>

<p>This is another example of the corporate media pushing a narrative at the expense of facts.</p>

          <p>Politico published an article in May 2017 claiming that the NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg told a former senior NATO official that Trump has a “12-second attention span”. The author does not cite how she got this information.</p>

<p>Moments after the official Politico account tweeted the article, Oana Lungescu, an official NATO Spokesperson, responds to the tweet asking Politico to withdraw the claim given that Stoltenberg never made this statement.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Y8Jy4Xc.jpg" class="-outline -tweet" /></p>

<p>Politico couldn’t defend the claim and was forced to make a correction within the article. The tweet quoting the claim was never removed.</p>

<p>It’s scary that the article author, who is supposed to be an unbiased and objective reporter, had decided to publish an unsubstantiated quote that has ramifications on the important relationship between the United States and NATO.</p>

          <p>Since 2010, US’s GDP growth has stagnated at around 2%. Donald Trump set a 3% annual GDP growth goal. As expected, the media has assumed a highly critical position. Here are some examples:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.latimes.com/business/hiltzik/la-fi-3percent-20170519-story.html">“If Trump thinks he can get more than 3% economic growth, he’s dreaming”</a> - Michael Hiltzik, Los Angeles Times</li>

  <li><a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/sorry-mr-trump-the-only-way-to-get-to-3-growth-is-to-hire-more-mexicans-2016-12-05">“Sorry, Mr. Trump, but the only way to get to 3% growth is to hire more Mexicans”</a> - Rex Nutting, MarketWatch</li>
  <li><a href="https://money.cnn.com/2016/10/11/news/economy/trump-four-percent-growth-economists/index.html">“Trump promises 4% growth. Economists say no way.”</a> - Patrick Gillespie, CNN Money</li>

</ul>

<p>Well, unfortunately for the media, the US is well on it’s way to reach the 3% goal. In Q2 of 2018, GDP growth reached a spectacular 4.1%, the highest quarterly GDP growth rate in 2014.</p>

          <p>… that Trump is one of the most pro-Israel presidents we’ve had in recent times. Trump, for one, was the first president to actually relocate the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem since the Jerusalem Embassy Act of 1995 became law. Despite the act becoming law, Clinton, Bush, and Obama repeatedly invoked a six-month waiver of the application of the law (which includes the relocation of the US embassy to Jerusalem).</p>

<p>In fact, the Israeli ambassador to the United States, Ron Dermer, said on July 23rd, 2018, has this to say:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“There has never been a U.S. administration more supportive of Israel than the Trump administration. Frankly, it is not even close. …This is an administration that sees Israel as an ally and that treats Israel as an ally. Today, the alliance between Israel and America has never been stronger.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Despite this, Newsweek ran an article implying that Donald Trump is anti-Semitic because he used the word “globalist”. I’m surprised the term “globalist” is even anti-Semitic. Is “globalisation” an anti-Semitic concept? At this point, many reporters seem to be grasping at straws to paint Donald Trump as the racist, white supremacist, anti-Semitic, xenophobic, hateful, anti-LGBTQIA, misogynistic, incompetent president.</p>

          <p>In November last year, a story came out that Donald Trump, while in a fish-feeding PR event with the Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in the Akasaka Palace, was impatient and ignorant of foreign customs and dumped an entire box of fish food into the pond.</p>

<p>Here are a few examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li>“Trump and Abe spooning fish food into a pond. (Toward the end, @potus decided to just dump the whole box in for the fish)” - <a href="https://twitter.com/justinsink/status/927372928227819521">Justin Sink, Bloomberg’s White House reporter</a></li>
  <li>“Big stupid baby dumps a load of fish food on Japanese koi pond” - <a href="https://twitter.com/Jezebel/status/927490456237301760">Jezebel</a></li>
  <li>“Trump and Japanese PM Shinzo Abe were scheduled to feed koi spoonfuls of food. Until Trump poured his entire box of fish food into the pond.” - CNBC’s Christina Wilkie (deleted tweet)</li>
  <li>“White House reporters, keen perhaps to pick up on a Trump gaffe, captured the moment when he upended his box on their smartphones and tweeted evidence of his questionable grasp of fish keeping. Some speculated that a poor palace employee would be dispatched to the scene to clean up the mess as soon as the two leaders disappeared inside.” - <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/nov/06/trump-dump-president-throws-entire-box-of-fish-food-into-precious-koi-carp-pond">The Guardian</a> (this article was later corrected)</li>
  <li>“President Trump feeds fish with PM Shinzo Abe in Japan, then pours the entire box of food into the koi pond.” - <a href="https://twitter.com/VeronicaRochaLA/status/927400669996130305">CNN’s Veronica Rocha</a></li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/nJluWFQ.jpg" class="-outline -tweet" /></p>

<p>The problem is, Trump wasn’t the only one who poured his entire box of fish food into the pond. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe actually did it first.</p>

<p>The scary thing is, CNN’s tweet actually contained a video that purposely edited out Abe so viewers would not see that Trump was actually following Abe’s lead.</p>

</ul>

<p>First of all, talk about a conspiracy theory. The mainstream media loves to label theories they disagree with as conspiracy theories, yet when it’s something they want to happen, they embrace a conspiracy theory with open arms. There is no concrete proof (emphasis on “concrete”) that Trump is a Russian asset. If one tries hard enough, one can draw Russian connections to every billionaire in the world. It’s a globalized world. If Trump was actually a Russian asset, it doesn’t require journalists to dig around to discover evidence, he would immediately be outed by any of the country’s intelligence agencies that have tens of billions of dollars in annual funding. Trump has been in office for almost 2 years. If the Russian government had an exploitative relationship with Trump, it would have been discovered by now.</p>

<p>In any case, it’s interesting that amid all this frenzy with Trump-Russia connections, the “objective” media has been eerily silent about the Clinton family’s connections with Russia. One standout example is Bill Clinton’s 2010 speech in Moscow to a Russian investment bank, Renaissance Capital. Clinton received $500,000 from the bank for the speech.</p>

<p>Interestingly, Rosatom, Russia’s nuclear energy agency, had recently announced their intention to acquire a majority stake in Uranium One, a Canadian company responsible for 20% of the US’s uranium mining output. Coincidentally, Renaissance Capital started promoting Uranium One stock during this time and, in a July 2010 research report, claimed that the company’s stock was “the best play” in the uranium markets.</p>

<p>Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State during this time and she approved the sale of Uranium One to Rosatom.</p>

<p>It’s also interesting to note that <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2017/11/14/hillary-clinton-uranium-one-deal-russia-explainer-244895">“several of Uranium One’s owners were also donors to the Clinton Foundation, giving $145 million to the charitable foundation”</a>.</p>

          <p>It’s widely known that the South African government is seizing land without fair compensation from the nation’s white-owned farms. In March 1st, 2018, Quartz Africa published this article, <a href="https://qz.com/africa/1218309/south-africa-to-take-land-without-compensation-as-zimbabwe-backtracks-on-seizing-white-farms/">“Expropriating land without compensation is impossible - take it from Zimbabwe”</a>. On August 21st, 2018, news.com.au released this article, <a href="https://www.news.com.au/finance/economy/world-economy/south-africa-begins-seizing-whiteowned-farms/news-story/8937f899bd3f131bfc4ffb648ea5c53b">“South Africa begins seizing white-owned farms”</a>.</p>

<p>In response to this news, Trump tweeted:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I have asked Secretary of State @SecPompeo to closely study the South Africa land and farm seizures and expropriations and the large scale killing of farmers. “South African Government is now seizing land from white farmers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The mainstreaming media immediately pounced on Trump’s tweet by claiming that this narrative is perpertrated by “white supremacists”. First of all, it’s unfortunate that the media loves to arbitrarily give hateful labels like “white supremacist” and “racist” to anyone they disagree with. Often times, there is no concrete proof or data that these people are actually white supremacists or racists and there is a huge cost to anyone being labeled as such. These labels should NOT be thrown around lightly.</p>

<p>One of the media organizations that responded to Trump’s tweet is Newsweek. They recently published an article titled <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/white-nationalists-trump-south-african-farmers-1087549">“WHITE NATIONALISTS PRAISE DONALD TRUMP FOR SPREADING WHITE SOUTH AFRICAN FARMERS CONSPIRACY THEORY”</a>. Unfortunately, it’s quite hypocritical of Newsweek to claim Donald Trump is spreading this “conspiracy theory” when they themsleves published an article on March 19th titled <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/white-farmer-killed-every-five-days-south-africa-authorities-do-nothing-851470">“A WHITE FARMER IS KILLED EVERY FIVE DAYS IN SOUTH AFRICA AND AUTHORITIES DO NOTHING ABOUT IT, ACTIVISTS SAY”</a></p>

          <p>Rose McGowan is  one of the leaders of the MeToo movement. On November 17th, 2017, she <a href="https://twitter.com/rosemcgowan/status/931338274542460928?lang=en">tweeted</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It’s quite simple, all who have worked with known predators should do 3 simple things. 1) Believe survivors 2) Apologize for putting your careers and wallets before what was right 3) Grab a spine and denounce. If you do not do these things you are still moral cowards. #ROSEARMY</p>
</blockquote>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/srfV53x.jpg" class="-outline -tweet" /></p>

<p>When a bombshell report revealed that Asia Argento agreed to pay $380,000 to an actor who accused her of sexually assaulting him when he was 17 years old, she tweet:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>None of us know the truth of the situation and I’m sure more will be revealed. Be gentle,” she added, sparking condemnations and accusations of hypocrisy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/q3kOLfx.jpg" class="-outline -tweet" /></p>

<p>Her double standards are clear here. For her friends, they deserve to be innocent until proven guilty. For others, they are guilty until proven innocent. Beyond this incident, it’s crazy that she, and the rest of the MeToo movement, actually believes guilty until proven innocent is civil and moral.</p>

<p>McGowan has since deleted the tweet.</p>

          <p>On June 25th, Taylor Cox, a writer for many children’s TV shows including Just Add Magic, Swamp Talk with Shrek &amp; Donkey, OMG!, and Kung Fu Panda tweeted this statement: “the only anxiety i have about white Extinction is that it’s not happening fast enough”.</p>

<p>Cox has since deleted the tweet and took her Twitter account private.</p>

<p>For a progressive, it’s surprising that she has convinced herself that it’s okay to publicly ask for the extinction of an entire human race. I guess, when your need to virtue signal overcomes critical thinking, this is the result.</p>
