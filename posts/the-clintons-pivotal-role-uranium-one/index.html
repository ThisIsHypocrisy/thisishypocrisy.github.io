    <p>The mainstream media loves to suggest that Donald Trump is controlled by the Russian government, even in the absence of concrete proof. They spin any small connection between the Trump family and a Russian entity as a possibility that Trump is a Russian puppet.</p>

<p>Some examples:</p>

  <li>And thousands more of articles with similar themes from “esteemed” media organizations</li>
</ul>

<p>First of all, talk about a conspiracy theory. The mainstream media loves to label theories they disagree with as conspiracy theories, yet when it’s something they want to happen, they embrace a conspiracy theory with open arms. There is no concrete proof (emphasis on “concrete”) that Trump is a Russian asset. If one tries hard enough, one can draw Russian connections to every billionaire in the world. It’s a globalized world. If Trump was actually a Russian asset, it doesn’t require journalists to dig around to discover evidence, he would immediately be outed by any of the country’s intelligence agencies that have tens of billions of dollars in annual funding. Trump has been in office for almost 2 years. If the Russian government had an exploitative relationship with Trump, it would have been discovered by now.</p>

<p>In any case, it’s interesting that amid all this frenzy with Trump-Russia connections, the “objective” media has been eerily silent about the Clinton family’s connections with Russia. One standout example is Bill Clinton’s 2010 speech in Moscow to a Russian investment bank, Renaissance Capital. Clinton received $500,000 from the bank for the speech.</p>

<p>Interestingly, Rosatom, Russia’s nuclear energy agency, had recently announced their intention to acquire a majority stake in Uranium One, a Canadian company responsible for 20% of the US’s uranium mining output. Coincidentally, Renaissance Capital started promoting Uranium One stock during this time and, in a July 2010 research report, claimed that the company’s stock was “the best play” in the uranium markets.</p>

<p>Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State during this time and she approved the sale of Uranium One to Rosatom.</p>

<p>It’s also interesting to note that <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2017/11/14/hillary-clinton-uranium-one-deal-russia-explainer-244895">“several of Uranium One’s owners were also donors to the Clinton Foundation, giving $145 million to the charitable foundation”</a>.</p>
