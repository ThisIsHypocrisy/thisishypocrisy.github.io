    <p>There was a brief period of public outrage against family separations at the border. Mainstream media organizations published article after article admonishing Trump on the issue. The problem is, family separations at the border are not exclusive to the Trump administration, they happened frequently under Obama too. Not surprisingly, the media gave Obama a pass on the issue.</p>

<p>Family separations at the border happen when adults with accompanying children are caught illegally crossing the border. If the adults were prosecuted and sent to a federal jail, the children are required by law to be separated from them. The children cannot stay in federal jail with their prosecuted adults.</p>

<p>Prosecuting adults for illegally crossing the border is not a new practice, nor is it unreasonable (since it’s illegal). However, not all adults who illegally cross the border are prosecuted, some are held in immigration detention until a judge determines whether to deport them or not. If the adults are not prosecuted, family separation does not occur.</p>

<p>The Obama administration prosecuted adults caught illegally crossing the border and thus would often separate families. In fact, in July 2014, the Fair Immigration Reform Movement (FIRM) issued a blistering press release denouncing the Obama administration’s “needless family separations”.</p>

<p>Here’s an excerpt from the <a href="https://fairimmigration.org/press/president-obama-must-stop-family-separation-crisis">press release</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“This week alone, hundreds if not thousands of children will lose parents to our broken immigration system, which causes needless family separations every day. A recent report noted that more than 72,000 children lost parents to deportations in 2013 alone. Against that backdrop, President Obama and his Administration would do well in moving to provide relief to immigrant families who would otherwise live in fear of separation”.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On this issue, the only difference between the Obama and Trump administrations is that the latter established a “zero tolerance” policy to prosecute all adults caught illegally crossing the border. Although this increases the rate of family separations, the exact increase is unknown.</p>

<p>The mainstream media stirred public outrage at Trump for family separations at the border, but were oddly quiet when the same kind of separations happened under Obama. Did the media believe that migrant families separated under Obama were less important than the families separated under Trump? Or do they not care about those families and are really just pushing an agenda?</p>

<p>Finally, besides the double standard in reporting, the outrage against family seperations for illegal border crossings simply does not make sense. Migrants can easily follow the law to avoid family seperations. In addition, family seperations already happen frequently within the country (prosecuted and jailed parents are separated from their children). Why do migrants deserve better treatment if they break the law?</p>
