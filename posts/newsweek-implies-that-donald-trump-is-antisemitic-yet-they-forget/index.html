    <p>… that Trump is one of the most pro-Israel presidents we’ve had in recent times. Trump, for one, was the first president to actually relocate the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem since the Jerusalem Embassy Act of 1995 became law. Despite the act becoming law, Clinton, Bush, and Obama repeatedly invoked a six-month waiver of the application of the law (which includes the relocation of the US embassy to Jerusalem).</p>

<p>In fact, the Israeli ambassador to the United States, Ron Dermer, said on July 23rd, 2018, has this to say:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“There has never been a U.S. administration more supportive of Israel than the Trump administration. Frankly, it is not even close. …This is an administration that sees Israel as an ally and that treats Israel as an ally. Today, the alliance between Israel and America has never been stronger.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Despite this, Newsweek ran an article implying that Donald Trump is anti-Semitic because he used the word “globalist”. I’m surprised the term “globalist” is even anti-Semitic. Is “globalisation” an anti-Semitic concept? At this point, many reporters seem to be grasping at straws to paint Donald Trump as the racist, white supremacist, anti-Semitic, xenophobic, hateful, anti-LGBTQIA, misogynistic, incompetent president.</p>
